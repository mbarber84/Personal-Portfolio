                <h2 style="text-align:center;">PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
                <p>My interests within computing cover a multitude of areas including hardware, cloud computing, virtual
                    networks, and programming. I completed my HNC last year and I am continuing my studies with a view
                    to complete my HND which has covered a wide variety of subject within computing and is why I would
                    like to continue on now to do a digital and technical solutions degree. When I first started my
                    course, I believed I would be aiming to stick with what I am was good at, which is repair and
                    maintenance. I believed this because of the work I have done in the past. While doing the course I
                    found myself drawn to other areas such as programming and software development, seeing how you can
                    design and develop an application with both front-end and back-end coding.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During my time in higher education, I have acquired both technical and practical skills, along with
                    the ability to know how to apply them effectively for business. I particularly enjoy coding in
                    Python due to its nature of its simplicity and its versatility, allowing you to be a creating and
                    complex as you would like. I have experience with how to improve the dynamic content of websites
                    using JavaScript. I also have experience with SQL relational database management systems along with
                    PHP, C#, and Java. Other aspects I found rewarding include project management unit and research unit
                    on remote working. I have chosen a challenging area of healthcare. Along with the paper came
                    different methodologies along with primary and secondary research, as well as proposed solution to
                    what we discovered. I have also furthered my technical and interpersonal skills by completing online
                    courses, during my HNC I used Udemy to complete seven computer-based courses all in different areas
                    and this trend has continued this year, I have completed sixteen IMB badges to date.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What makes me different, I could talk about being from a home with disabled mother and three children
                    or about my time served in the military both the British Army as a mechanic in the REME and the
                    Royal Navy as a Steward on the HMS Bulwark and being medically discharged which all make for great
                    stories. Even all the different jobs I have been through since leaving the military doing everything
                    from landscape gardening to sales and customer service even working as a technician for a ground gas
                    company. But the thing that makes me different and stand out is from the pack is the fact I am
                    bi-polar, I look at this as a positive for me, it allows me to have a new way at looking and
                    approaching things. My bi-polar comes with OCD so I have better attention to detail than most, my
                    anxiety provides me with motivation to complete my work promptly and to a high. When you combine
                    this with everything from my past, the drive to succeed my family have given me, the discipline,
                    time keeping, teamwork and leadership skills from the military and even things like active listening
                    from customer service, all goes to show what sort of person I am and how I can take lessons from any
                    situation giving me the chance to learn and grow.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I hope by illustrating my personal qualities, skills, academic qualifications, and high results
                    achieved that my application will be considered. My combination of personal experience, ambition and
                    determination demonstrate that I would be well suited for my chosen course, university. I am
                    confident in my ability to succeed on my chosen course given my track history and I am hoping for a
                    chance to prove myself through enthusiasm, commitment, and a willingness to learn.</p>
