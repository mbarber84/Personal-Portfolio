        <h1>Unity Projects</h1>
        <div>
            <p>For these games I have chosen to use Unity as my development tool. Unity was released back in 2005 at
                Apple Inc WDC as a cross-platform game engine for the Mac OS X. It can build for and support more than
                25 platforms including Windows, macOS, and also consoles and virtual reality platforms like PlayStation
                VR Xbox One, Oculus Rift, Daydream. It allows you to build in 2D, 3D as well as in virtual reality.
                Unity Technologies designed the platform not only to be used to design and build games but also to be
                used across other industries such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.</p>
            <p>The reason for using Unity for these builds is due to my familiarity with the engine, the limitations of
                the
                network I will be build it on, as I have limited space for the game and the fact it has its own assets
                store to find anything you need for the game but also it has association with sites like Blender for if
                I need to create anything from scratch and import it and Mixamo to allow me to use pre-designed
                characters and there motions which will save time and make the game more astatically pleasing. Also all
                scripts can be done is a well known language, C++.</p><br>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>The story is told that Ludwig gets offered a job by a strange man working down in a mine. Little does
                Ludwig know that what's he is about to on earth is called The Great Unknown. The Great Unknown also
                known as the bringer of death and the destroyer of worlds was trapped on this planet as it was formed,
                keeping it from destroying everything, for a millennia it has been dormant just wait for its chance to
                escape.
                Once Ludwig realises what he's done he takes it upon himself to try and undo what he has done.
                In the endless runner you never see what he is running from as it is The Great Unknown and as such
                should only be revealed in a later game.
            </p><br>
            <p>The story for this game is being kept simple, Sir Ludwig the Indestructible is being chased by the Great
                Unknown and has found himself trapped in the limbo of a seemingly never-ending bridge with no escape. He
                can’t stop himself from running even if he wanted to and the longer, he runs the faster he gets, but he
                must continually stay on his toes because if at any moment his mind wonders he will collide with an
                obstacle and die, with his sole being stolen by the Great Unknown</p><br>
            <h3>Character</h3>
            <p>The character has been chosen from the website Mixamo, as you can see, he is a knight with a sword and
                shield. The Knight has named after my love of Black Adder he is called Sir Ludwig the Indestructible as
                an homage to Hugh Laurie who plays the character of a German master of disguise.</p><br>

        <h2>Hobby Project</h2>
        <p>After starting this project for college, sadly i discovered that it was to complex and large to be ran on the
            college network, so it became a little hobby and passion project.</p><br>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>
                We start with a military veteran sitting on his old dirty couch, alone, drinking whisky. He’s watching
                TV as a news report hits, “The Soviet Union has reform and declared war on Europe”. As he continues to
                watch in disbelief as soldiers invade every country.
                He runs from his house when an explosion hits him. Everything goes black. He wakes up, its pitch black,
                he realises he’s in a bag and unzips it slowly, making sure not to make any sound or draw any attention
                to himself, it was a body bag. He’s in a basement but not sure where or why…..
            </p>
            <h3>Aim</h3>
            <p>The aim of the game is to be a first-person shooter, allowing the main character to complete tasks to
                pass through the levels. The main goal being to stay alive and help fight back the invasion, with
                secondary goals being finding other veterans to help. Find weapons to use or simply taking them off the
                bodies of your enemies can assist with fighting off the Soviet soldiers. </p>
            <h3>Character</h3>
            <p>The hero and main character of the game is a military veteran, who was medically discharged due to
                injury. His name is Corporal Jon Jones. He has struggled finding his was back in civilian life, having
                just lost his latest job working in an office as customer service. With life beating him down he has let
                himself go and turned to drinking, whiskey is his favoured tipple. Even with all this he is still
                military at heart ready to fight and give his life for what he believes in.</p><br>
